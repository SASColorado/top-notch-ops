## ⚖️ Legal Foundation – Statutes & Court Rules

### 1. **Colorado Rule of County Court Civil Procedure 508(c)**  
> *"Corporations, partnerships, associations and other organizations may be represented before the Small Claims Court by an officer, a partner, an employee, a regularly retained attorney or any other person authorized by law."*

✅ Top Notch Lawn Care LLC qualifies under this rule to be represented by:  
- An officer or full-time employee (as defined under business structure)
- A managing member or agent of its sole member (SAS Colorado Holdings LLC)

---

### 2. **Colorado Revised Statutes § 13-1-127(2)**  
> *"A closely held entity may be represented before any court of record by an officer of such entity if the amount at issue does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars and the entity has no more than three owners."*

✅ Top Notch is a **closely held entity** because:
- It has **one owner** (SAS Colorado Holdings LLC)
- SAS is managed by **Saleem Ahmed Schultz**, who handles Top Notch operations  
- Claims filed are typically under $15,000  
- Schultz is acting as an **officer of the owner entity**, not as an outside agent

### 3. **Relevant Case Law**

#### 🔹 *Fogelson v. Steele*, 2009 Colo. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1711  
> Found that a managing member of an LLC appearing in small claims **did not engage in unauthorized practice of law**, and was fully authorized to represent the company.
