## üîç Breakdown by Court

### ‚úÖ Small Claims Court (up to $7,500)
- Best for standard unpaid invoices or simple disputes
- Fast, low cost, no discovery
- **No lawyers allowed** unless the defendant brings one
- Judge may ask for business license or entity structure proof

### ‚úÖ County Court (up to $25,000)
- Use if claim > $7,500
- **You can still represent Top Notch** if total claim is ‚â§ $15,000 and Top Notch is a closely held company (under 3 owners) ‚Äì per **C.R.S. ¬ß 13-1-127**
- More formal than small claims, some discovery allowed
- Filing fees are higher but still reasonable

### ‚ùå District Court (over $25,000)
- Complex, expensive
- Attorney is **required**
- Only used for major lawsuits (e.g., subcontractor negligence causing client to sue Top Notch for $30k+)

## üèõÔ∏è Venue Rules (Where to File)

> File in the county where **the job occurred**, or where **the defendant resides or does business**

| Type of Defendant      | Venue Location                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Residential Client     | County where client lives       |
| Business Client        | County of business registration or where job occurred |
| Remote Jobsite         | County where services were rendered |

‚úÖ You can file across counties (e.g. Denver client for a job done in Aurora ‚Äî either Denver or Arapahoe County is valid)

---

## üß± Structural Compliance Required to File

Before filing, ensure:
- Top Notch is listed as **plaintiff**, not Saleem Schultz personally
- You use Top Notch‚Äôs **EIN and entity address**
- You do NOT sue from SAS Colorado Holdings unless it‚Äôs the actual claimant
- You attach `/legal-handbook/01-representation-authority.md` if questioned
- Internal memo (in `/lawsuits/client-name/memo.md`) is logged

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Triggers for Dismissal or Challenge

- Filing in the wrong court (e.g. small claims for $9,000)
- Suing under your own name, not Top Notch‚Äôs
- Filing in a county with no job/client connection
- Defendant requests transfer due to incorrect jurisdiction
- Failing to show proof of ownership/authority
