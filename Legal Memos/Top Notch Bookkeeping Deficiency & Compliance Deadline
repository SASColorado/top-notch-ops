## üìç Subject: Bookkeeping Status ‚Äì Urgent Remediation Required

As of July 18, 2025, **Top Notch Lawn Care LLC is severely behind on its internal bookkeeping, expense categorization, and ledger maintenance**.

Numerous undocumented or unreviewed transactions remain from:
- Fuel purchases  
- Client payments  
- Intercompany expenses (Due to SAS)  
- Subcontractor payments  
- Labor hour logs and field wage journal entries  

This has created significant exposure in the event of an audit, tax review, or litigation. The company‚Äôs current ledger does not reflect an accurate or timely view of financial health.

## ‚õî Risk Summary

- Potential failure to justify tax deductions if records are not updated  
- Inability to reconcile client payments vs. completed jobs  
- Possible double-reporting of revenue or improper pass-through allocation  
- Legal risk if a contractor or customer dispute arises and job logs are incomplete  
- Breach of internal SAS compliance obligations regarding reporting accuracy

**All books must be brought current no later than July 31, 2025.**

This includes:
- Full reconciliation of all bank transactions  
- Entry and documentation of all intercompany expenses  
- Accurate labor and service tracking tied to daily logs  
- All revenue from Housecall Pro jobs mapped and categorized  
- Updates to the GitHub `/financial-audits/` folder and current ledger

## üîÑ Enforcement Plan

- A compliance notice will be issued
